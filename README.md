# My Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! This is a work in progress where you can learn more about me, my work, and what makes me tick.

## About

I'm currently in the process of completing the School of Code's intensive, full-stack bootcamp, where I've been diving into everything from front-end development and database engineering to DevOps and AI. Over the weeks, Iâ€™ve worked in agile teams, tackling projects that span the whole web development spectrum, including REACT, UX/UI, and cyber security. My final project was all about creating a community-driven social media app designed to help people connect in real life - putting more focus on genuine, face-to-face friendships. You can check out my School of Code projects alongside my personal side projects in the projects section (when they're up!).
