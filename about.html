            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>WELCOME TO MY ABOUT PAGE<br><br>Here you can learn more about me, my work and what makes me tick</p>
            <p class="bioSection">I'm currently in the process of completing the School of Code's intensive, full-stack bootcamp, where I've been diving into everything from front-end development and database engineering to DevOps and AI. Over the weeks, I’ve worked in agile teams, tackling projects that span the whole web development spectrum, including REACT, UX/UI, and cyber security. My final project was all about creating a community-driven social media app designed to help people connect in real life—putting more focus on genuine, face-to-face friendships. You can check out my School of Code projects alongside my personal side projects in the projects section. Coding started as a bit of fun, and now it’s become a full-blown passion.</p>
            <p class="bioSection">Before the world of tech, I spent 14 years as a primary school teacher and senior leader. I’ve taught various age groups, led school sports programmes, and even coordinated events across multiple schools. Beyond the classroom, I co-owned a craft beer and sports bar that’s still thriving today, even though I’ve since sold my share. We did some great work with charities like Football for Foodbanks and Football vs Homophobia, and I loved getting creative with poster designs for events. I built strong links with both local organisations like Altrincham FC and bigger groups like ThisFanGirl in London. After that chapter, I had a stint as a stay-at-home dad, keeping busy with a home-improvements business on the side. </p>
            <p class="bioSection">Outside of work and coding, I'm an outdoorsy type who loves cycling, running, and walking—though my knees don't appreciate football like they used to! I’m also a family man with a passion for music. You’ll often find me compiling playlists on Spotify or spinning records from my ever-growing collection. I’ve got a soft spot for classic bands like The Cure, The Beatles, and Talking Heads, but lately, I've been vibing to modern soul and psych acts like Thee Sacred Souls, Oracle Sisters, and Jalen Ngonda. Always on the lookout for my next musical discovery!</p>
